# FriendFinder

The Friend Finder app that takes allows the user to fill out a survey of questions and submit them to be compared with other surveys submitted by other to see which of them the user is most compatiable with based on the scores of their surveys.

###Technologies Used:
   * Node.js
   * Express
   * Javascript
   * Jquery
   * Bootstrap

###Getting Started:
The user will begin at the home page that has a button that will let the user begin the survey or 2 links at the bottom of the page that will take the user to the app's github repository or will show the user the survey results already in the system. 

Once the user selects to begin the survey, they will be directed to fill out a their name, provide the image address of a picture of themselves, then they can begin to select the answers for the 10 questions on the survey, and once they have answered all of the questions they get their result by clicking the submit button which causes the result to appear on the screen. Once the user has seen the result of their match they simple close the result and will be redirected to the app's home page.
